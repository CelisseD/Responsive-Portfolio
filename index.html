        <p id="bioText">Celisse is an aspiring web developer located in Orlando, FL. Celisse's passion for technology began at a very
            young age, when she started building websites and personal blogs using basic HTML and CSS in the early days of
            the internet. She is, as it turns out, very old. In any case, after working for 15 years in customer service and
            technology retail sales, she decided to persue her interests in creative web development, which brought her to
            UCF's Coding Bootcamp.<br><br>

        When she's not coding, you can find Celisse hanging out at Disney World, on a cruise, or playing with her tiny
            MaltiPoo, Maui.</p>
